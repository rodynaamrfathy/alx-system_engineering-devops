# My First Postmortem

## Issue Summary

**Duration of Outage:**  
- **Start Time:** 2024-06-01 14:00 UTC  
- **End Time:** 2024-06-01 16:30 UTC  

**Impact:**  
- The main service affected was our e-commerce website. 
- Users experienced a complete inability to access the site, with 100% of users affected during the outage.
- This resulted in a significant loss of sales and potential customer dissatisfaction.

**Root Cause:**  
- The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings during a routine maintenance update, which caused all incoming traffic to be directed to a single, under-resourced server.

## Timeline

- **14:00** - Issue detected via automated monitoring alerts indicating a sudden drop in website traffic and increase in server error rates.
- **14:05** - Alert confirmed by on-call engineer after attempting to access the site and experiencing the same issue reported by monitoring tools.
- **14:10** - Initial investigation began focusing on server health and network connectivity.
- **14:20** - Assumption made that the issue was related to a database overload due to recent promotional campaign traffic spike.
- **14:30** - Misleading path followed, involving scaling database resources and clearing query cache, with no resolution.
- **14:45** - Incident escalated to the network infrastructure team after no improvements were observed.
- **15:00** - Network team discovered the load balancer misconfiguration.
- **15:15** - Correct configuration restored to the load balancer.
- **15:30** - Website functionality partially restored but slow due to server strain.
- **16:00** - Full service restoration achieved after redistributing traffic across all servers and performing a system reboot to clear any residual issues.
- **16:30** - Monitoring confirmed stable operations and normal traffic patterns.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
- During a routine update to improve load balancing efficiency, a configuration error was introduced. 
- The load balancer was set to route all traffic to a single server instead of distributing it evenly. 
- This single server, not equipped to handle the full traffic load, became overwhelmed and started rejecting connections, resulting in a site-wide outage.

**Resolution:**  
- The resolution involved identifying the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. 
- Once discovered, the correct settings were reapplied to ensure even distribution of traffic across all available servers. 
- Additionally, a full system reboot was performed to reset and stabilize the server states. 
- Post-reboot, the traffic was monitored to ensure balanced distribution and optimal performance.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**  
To prevent future occurrences of similar issues, several measures can be implemented:

1. **Enhanced Configuration Review Process:**  
   Implement a more robust review process for any changes to critical system configurations, involving multiple team members for verification.

2. **Automated Configuration Validation:**  
   Develop automated scripts to validate configuration changes before they are applied, ensuring they meet predefined criteria for correctness.

3. **Load Balancer Monitoring:**  
   Add specific monitoring for load balancer performance and traffic distribution to detect anomalies early.

4. **Stress Testing:**  
   Regularly perform stress tests on individual servers and the entire system to understand capacity limits and response under high load conditions.

**Tasks:**

1. **Patch Load Balancer Configuration:**
   - Apply stricter validation rules and logging for all configuration changes.
   
2. **Implement Monitoring Enhancements:**
   - Enhance monitoring tools to include specific checks for load balancer health and traffic distribution metrics.
   
3. **Conduct Regular Stress Tests:**
   - Schedule regular stress testing sessions to evaluate server performance under high traffic conditions.
   
4. **Review and Update SOPs:**
   - Review and update standard operating procedures (SOPs) to include additional checks and balances for critical system updates.
